# Nova AI - Personal Resume Chatbot

Welcome to Nova! This is an interactive AI-powered chatbot built to answer any question about Chetanya Rathi's professional resume. Instead of just reading a static PDF, you can ask Nova questions in natural language.

This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware answers. The backend is powered by Python, Flask, and Google's Gemini AI, while the frontend is a dynamic chat interface built with React.

* **Vector Search:** Employs a ChromaDB vectorstore for fast and efficient similarity search on resume content.
* **Gemini-Powered:** Leverages Google's powerful `gemini-2.5-flash` model via the Vertex AI API for human-like and accurate responses.
